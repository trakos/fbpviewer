# Factorio Blueprint Viewer (fbpviewer)

This is a simple javascript canvas viewer for factorio blueprints.

Live version available here: [http://fbpviewer.trakos.pl/](http://fbpviewer.trakos.pl/)


## Development

If you want to run entire website, I recommend having docker installed. Then, you can simply run:

```
docker-compose up -d
bash bin/dev_init.sh
```

Database can be configured using environment variable DATABASE_URL.
Default is set for docker development in .env.dev and .dev.test.

You'd also have to add `php-docker.local` to your hosts file (to make it point to docker machine,
if you're using docker-machine you can find it's ip by calling `docker-machine ip`,
otherwise it's probably localhost).

You also have to have spritesheet generated. The best way is to simply download it from my website
(both `spritesheet.json` and `spritesheet.png`) and put it in `/web/images`.

You could also use the script at `bin/dev_atlasgen.sh` to generate it yourself,
but it requires you to copy most of the factorio images to `web/images/factorio` first.
