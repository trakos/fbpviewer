# Factorio Blueprint Viewer (fbpviewer)

This is a simple javascript canvas viewer for factorio blueprints.

Live version available here: [http://bluetorio.tk/](http://bluetorio.tk/)


## Development

To run fbpviewer locally, you'll need docker and docker-compose.

First, create `.env` files with following 3 variables set:

```.dotenv
# Path to extracted https://factorio.com/get-download/0.15.40/alpha/linux64
FACTORIO_DIR=~/Downloads/factorio
# This will be used as web host in docker. 
NGINX_HOST=php-docker.local
NGINX_PORT=80
```

Next, you can start docker by running:

```shell
make start
```

## Production

To build production docker images, run:

```shell
make build-docker-factorio-data
make build-docker-prod-images
```

The first command requires `FACTORIO_DIR` to be set and creates fbpviewer_factorio_data image.
I'd recommend pushing it somewhere and reusing it.

Second command creates `fbpviewer_prod_php` and `fbpviewer_prod_nginx` images that have all
source files and assets already built and initialized.

You can test them locally using `make start-prod` that will use `docker-compose-prod.yml` file.
It's similar to `make start`, but uses prebuilt images instead of mounting local directory.

To execute migrations, run `make migrate` after deployment.

### Environment variables

- `DATABASE_URL`, `DATABASE_USER` and `DATABASE_PASSWORD`:
  You have to set those to mysql or oracle database credentials.
- `ORACLE_CWALLET_SSO`: You can set this to base64-encoded oracle DB's cwallet.so.
  It will be un-encoded during runtime and stored in /var/www/var/cwallet.sso.
- `NGINX_HOST`: You have to set this to domain that your application uses.
